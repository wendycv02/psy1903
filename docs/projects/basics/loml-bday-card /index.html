            <p>Dear Love of My Life,</p>
            <p class="card-text">How does it feel to be an old man? Just kidding! What were the odds of us being
                born
                in the same lifetime, same generation, and the same country yet meeting in a completely different
                one? I
                feel so blessed to have you in my life; I can't imagine it without you. You're of the stuff that
                love
                and dreams are made of—the greatest gift that life has given me, and I cherish you more deeply than
                you
                could imagine. Here's to spending all the rest of our birthdays together, my love.</p>

            <p class="card-text">I love you, my darling—Happy birthday to the bestest, most handsome boy in the
                world!
            </p>
            <p>Yours always,</p>
            <p class="card-text">Carolina</p>
